### Why I build this blog
1. My major is software engineering , and I was a student  in famous University for 7 years,but I don't have my personal blog,which means that  I don't like do practice . So I want to encoure myself to do more practice .

2. I worked at Netease as a DBA for 4 years and wrote many wikis in the inner teams. These wikis mostly about how to solve the MySQL and MongoDB problem and some basic DB basics. Now I join the Tencent , I am still poor at writing code .I want to let this blog to record what i am learning code in the next 4 years.

3. I just want to give myself the power. It's not easy to keep on doing the same thing.


### Expectation
1. Writing the blog by english.

2. More code ,less description.
